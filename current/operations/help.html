                    Regulated cell death (RCD) is a form of cell death that is controlled by specific molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways within the cell. Unlike accidental or uncontrolled cell death (such as necrosis caused by acute injury), RCD is an active, genetically encoded process that can be triggered in response to various physiological or pathological stimuli.

                    Regulated cell death refers to any form of cell demise that is governed by a defined set of molecular events, often involving signaling cascades, gene expression changes, and the activation of specific proteins or enzymes. Well-known types of RCD include apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagic cell death, each characterized by distinct molecular features and biological outcomes.

                    RCD plays a fundamental role in maintaining tissue homeostasis, development, and immune defense. Its proper regulation is essential for: development and tissue remodeling, immune system function, disease prevention, and therapy response.

                    Prioritizing different types of regulated cell death (RCD) enables researchers to identify which RCD modalities are most relevant or active within specific biological contexts. By discerning these priorities, it becomes possible to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms driving cellular responses to various physiological or pathological stimuli. This approach not only enhances our understanding of the roles that distinct RCD pathways play in health and disease, but also aids in uncovering potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Ultimately, systematically evaluating the prominence of various RCD types across different conditions provides a valuable framework for elucidating the complex interplay between cell death processes and biological outcomes.
