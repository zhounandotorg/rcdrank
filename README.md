# RCDRank

RCDRank is an analytical framework to discern the priorities of RCD by integrating results of multiple methods. Utilizing p-value combination and robust rank aggregation, it estimates a combined p-value and a consensus enrichment score for each RCD modality.

RCDRank addresses a critical gap in RCD research: the lack of practical tools to determine which RCD types are functionally important in a specific biological context. Testing every known RCD modulator is costly and labor-intensive. It enables researchers to make data-driven decisions by leveraging RCD priorities, avoiding the costly and labor-intensive process of testing every known RCD modulator.
